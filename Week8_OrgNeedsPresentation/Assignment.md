# Signature Assignment: Integrate a Strategic Cybersecurity Approach

Using the organization that you selected for Week 7, the resources for Week 8, and extended exploration for this assignment, construct an integrated strategic cybersecurity approach that you can present to the board of your selected organization.

Pay particular attention to `including current` needs plus an emphasis on a strategy that could `optimize outcomes for the next five years`. Consider changes in the use of

- information,
- products,
- processes,
- people,
- external parties,
- changes in information assets,
- threats,
- and vulnerabilities.

Also, consider `changes in the nature of the organization`. Your objective is `not to describe in detail all of these changes`, but to `incorporate the results of these changes` within your strategic cybersecurity approach. The focus is on the `integrated nature of these diverse influences`. You would provide the detail of your approach, supported by citations, and brief details regarding the changes and current needs. Emphasize the `integrated strategy` rather than the granular detail of technology and related items. Your use of critical thinking and synthesis would be important elements in your success.

Provide a PowerPoint presentation for the board of your selected organization. Design your content to be highly organized and appropriate for `delivery to a board meeting`. Prepare for a `verbal presentation` in front of the board. Be sure to design your slides to `be appropriate for your target audience` in terms of content and avoid having too much content on the slides. Include pertinent `images and tables` that you have created.

## Standard Requirements

Length:

- Provide a title slide,
