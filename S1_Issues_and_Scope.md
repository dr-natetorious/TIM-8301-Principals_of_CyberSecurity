# Section 1: The Issues and Scope of Cybersecurity

## Evalaute the State of Cybersecurity

An [Evaluation of Cybsersecurity](Week1_Evaluation/BachmeierNTIM8301-1.docx) explores the challenges of operating within an ever changing threat landscape.  Risk management is turning towards technologies such as machine learning and automation, though these systems introduce opaqueness across internal decisions.

## People, Processes, and Products

It is equally important that mitigations protect against malicious and negligent behavior[PPTX](Week2_PeopleAspects/BachmeierNTIM8301-2.pptx)[MP4](Week2_PeopleAspects/BachmeierNTIM8301-2.mp4)[DOCX](Week2_PeopleAspects/BachmeierNTIM8301-2.docx).  These issues require awareness training and least privilege mitigations to scope the blast radius of erroneous behavior.

## Influence of Global Security

The [Internet has a geography](Week3_GlobalSecurity/BachmeierNTIM8301-3.docx) because different nations want to protect their sovereignty.  As an organization expands into multi-national corporations, they need to understand the risks of operating in different countries as the legal and political values may vary from domestic environments.

## Malware and Encryption Options

Organizations strategies to protect against [malware and protect their data](Week4_MalwareEncryption/BachmeierNTIM8301-4.docx).  Ransomware attacks are evolving into frequent attacks across businesses.  In addition to protecting sensitive data, encryption also seeks to [1] ensure the integrity of information and [2] authenticate the identity of a source.

## Description of Section

Cybersecurity provides a significant risk to all organizations and individuals. Each of these parties risks their survival, assets, relationships, and the people dependent on them. The threats vary from physical equipment and locations to software and firmware used, the people active with all of these components, local and global laws, people dependent on them, and the dependent organization or persons.

To defend or prevent the losses outlined above, you need to combine locations, things, people, and knowledge. It is the combination, including the willingness to allocate these resources, that can reduce the probability of losses. The implication is that you need to integrate technologists, things, and the leadership of organizations. Any assumption that you have to focus on only one area is sure to lead to failure. This course, therefore, seeks to consider all of these areas and how you might put the pieces together to reduce the probability of cybersecurity losses and catastrophes.

Within the career areas, tactical issues, deep knowledge of diverse areas, the most current updates, and research are typically combined. Your selection of this degree implies that you will also complete research. The emphasis on research within your dissertation does not mean that you can avoid all of the other areas. You will use existing sources to aid your preparation to become a knowledge leader and researcher in this area.

One of the recognized sources of knowledge comes from the common body of knowledge (CBK) that is documented by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium [(ISC)2]. Other valuable sources on the Internet include SANS, the Cybersecurity Framework, and the Risk Management Framework. These resources have generic value and are likely to play a part throughout your degree and career. You can review these sources in the libguide for this course.

For this course, the aim is to provide a foundation leading to your scientific research, and youâ€™ll start with the Certified Information Security Systems Professional (CISSP), specifically the outline and concepts contained in the CBK. To set a focus on research, the emphasis within the course will remain focused on scholarly articles found in the NCU Library. Despite this, the external resources mentioned here will add important practical views and be useful knowledge for this course and the degree. The content is also useful in a more general sense within technology innovation and computer science.
