# Malware and Encryption

It has been some time since viruses, worms, and Trojans were in the news. Despite this, there are still important parts of defending individuals and organizations. You might have heard about ransomware invading people or organizations. Email compromises and fraud still pose a larger threat to the economy; however, the level of damage caused changes frequently. Many of these issues include some roots in malware, and large organizations find it important to test and analyze suspicious code using a tool within a sandbox.

Risks also propagate by way of pieces of code sold on the Dark Web. They are typically joined and adjusted during the lifetime of the attack and may affect larger software solutions, firmware issues, and embedded content within regular data such as images or video. The continual evolution of dangerous code and the inclusion of snippets within other products creates a broadening exposure. Later, you will consider the phenomenal growth for items such as the Internet of Things; exacerbating existing network connectivity and data flows. Social media and the interconnectedness between organizations are some of these examples. There is a wide area of potential harm.

Currently, encryption and various methods of protecting passwords, sessions, and other data flows evolve continuously with new techniques and increasing hardware capabilities threatening previous solutions that were deemed safe. As an example, consider the ongoing improvements needed for wireless networks going from WEP to WPA, and WPA2. The last has now been proven unsafe. Techniques and tools must continue to improve, but they also require some form of cost-effective digital identity whereby individuals can safely identify themselves and their permissions.
