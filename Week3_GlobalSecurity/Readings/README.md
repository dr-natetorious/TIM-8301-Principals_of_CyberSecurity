## The Role of Healthcare Technology Management in Facilitating Medical Device Cybersecurity (2017)

In _Biomedical instrumentation & technology 2017 Sep 02; Vol. 51 (s6), pp. 19-25._; [Busdicker, M; Upendra, P](MedicalDeviceSecurity.pdf) discusses patterns and practices for adding security into medical devices in the presence of finite resources.  Despite nearly 41% of medical device manufactures agreeing that: _within one year an attack against their product was likely_, only 17% has taken significant steps to prevent it.

These attacks have evolved from information theft into `ransomware`, where the sensitive data is encrypted and the malware authors then sell the decryption key.  The unavailability of both data and technology systems in health care, can introduce undue harm to patients and prevent them receiving time sensitive attention.

Mitigating these attacks requires better communication across the ecosystem, from the device manafactures to the IT staff that support them in production.  `Awareness` of proper lifecycle management can reduce the attack surface and lessen the chances of compromise.  For instance, the devices require patching and archival solutions.  When these _internal solutions_ are not available, then an _external solution_, like network access controls (NACL) must exist to provide those security guarantees.  These solutions are not limited to technical systems, but also require manual inspection and inventory.

Communication also means sufficient training of non-technical staff, so they know the dangers associated with decisions. For example, a nurse might connect a sensitive device to the guest WiFi instead of a secure Access Point (AP).  While this has resolved the connectivity issue it also allows for malware to discover and interact with it.  Later, moving the device back to the private network could bring that malware into the trusted environment.

The lifecycle management does not end with the device being turned off.  It needs to exend through a secure termination and destruction process, so that private information does not leak into the physical recycle bin.

## Unhackable quantum networks take to space [News] (2017)

In _IEEE Spectrum (Volume: 54 , Issue: 8 , August 2017), pp. 12-13_; [Choi, C](QuantumNetworking.pdf) writes an article about quantum networking in space (QNS).  QNS relies on entanglement and has proven to work though the detection rate is very poor 1 per 5.8m pairs per second.  Newer technologies are focusing on lasers instead of entanglement and hope to have something commercially available within 5+/- years.  

In [TIM-7020 Week 6](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-7020-Database_and_Business_Intelligence/tree/master/Week6_CuttingEdge_Proposal), a detailed analysis of Quantum technologies is available and how these concepts can be applied to software design patterns.  

## ZERO-DAY RESPONSIBILITY: THE BENEFITS OF A SAFE HARBOR FOR CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH (2017)

In _Jurimetrics: The Journal of Law, Science & Technology. Summer2017, Vol. 57 Issue 4, p483-503. 21p._; [Emery, A](ZeroDayResponsibility.pdf) states that zero-day exploits, _there are zero days in which to prepare for the threat_, are openly sold on the internet.  The national defence department and criminal organizations, purchase large quantities of these issues for survaillence.  A core challenge with regulating this industry is that it requires an overhaul of the cybersecurity laws, so the authors propose leveraging tort laws (see [LAW531 Week 2](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/LAW-531_Business_Law/tree/master/Week2_Torts)).  Another challenge comes from `awareness` that these zero-day attacks are launched against individuals, corporations, and governments through _spray attacks_ (eg., drive by exploitation) and there is significant risk.

### What is a software vulnerability

> According to Microsoft Security Response Center [a vulnerability] is "a weakness in a product that could be used by an attacker to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of that product."

These issues originate from poor configurations, software design flaws, code defects, and missing features.

### How are zero-days regulated today

1. Calling on criminal law to regulate the market (e.g., Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)
2. Proposing liability to developers that release zero-days (eg, sue for negligence of release and vendor)
3. Advocating for export controls and laws to regulate trafficing (eg. Waasenaar Arrangements)

While these approaches prevent legitimate businesses and research, it does not prevent malicious actors nor nation states.  Responsible research is necessary for the legitimate actors to build protections into their systems and create security guarentees.  When legislatures propose suing the vendors for allowing the defect in the first place, this is a slippery slope, because building error free applicaitons is near impossible.  Even relatively obvious issues are often only visible after the fact.  Another challenge with legal processes is that they move substantually slower than technical innovation, and are unlikely to keep pace with a rapidly evolving landscape.

## China’s Three Warfares Strategy Mitigates Fallout From Cyber Espionage Activities (2016)

In _Journal of Strategic Security, Vol 9, Iss 2, Pp 47-71 (2016)_; [Emilio, I](ChinaWarfare.pdf)

## CYBERSECURITY -- the No. 1 threat facing manufacturers (2018)

In _Industrial Management. Jul/Aug2018, Vol. 60 Issue 4, p24-27. 4p._; [Erickson, A; Neilson, T](CyberSecurityManufactures.pdf) states that manufactures are a primary target for cybersecurity attacks and need to be aware of the risks.  Many manufactures do not believe that they are at risk and this makes them vulnerable.

> Hackers largely target the manufacturing industry to steal trade secrets, business plans and valuable intellectual property.

### How are they being attacked

- Espionage and Intellectual Property Theft
- Ransomware for Revenue
- Pure destruction and harm

### Impact of attacks

- Harm to reputation
- Destruction of data
- Loss in productivity
- Theft of intellectual property
- Theft of personal employee data
- Disruption to business continuity
- Damage to physical facilities
- Liability or fines for noncompliance with data-privacy regulations
- Possible legal action by customers and employees whose personal information has been breached
- Possible employees suing for lost wages if the company can’t pay due to the breach
- Costs of remediating the damage itself

### What is password spraying

An effective low-tech strategy is to run password cracking across the org instead of an individual account.  By guessing across all accounts that "12345" is the password it avoids detection and an individual account becoming disabled.

### How should we approach cybersecurity risk

The organization needs to define the risks towards its continutity, and then from the C-level down be responsible through ownership.  Challenges from cyber attacks need the same attention as any other aspect, such as supply chain shock or cash flow management.  When these issues are ignored they become a timebomb that will eventually cause a distruption and impact the companies ability to deliver success.
