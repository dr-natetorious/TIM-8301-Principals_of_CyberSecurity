## The Role of Healthcare Technology Management in Facilitating Medical Device Cybersecurity (2017)

In _Biomedical instrumentation & technology 2017 Sep 02; Vol. 51 (s6), pp. 19-25._; [Busdicker, M; Upendra, P](MedicalDeviceSecurity.pdf)

## Unhackable quantum networks take to space [News] (2017)

In _IEEE Spectrum (Volume: 54 , Issue: 8 , August 2017), pp. 12-13_; [Choi, C](QuantumNetworking.pdf) writes an article about quantum networking in space (QNS).  QNS relies on entanglement and has proven to work though the detection rate is very poor 1 per 5.8m pairs per second.  Newer technologies are focusing on lasers instead of entanglement and hope to have something commercially available within 5+/- years.  

In [TIM-7020 Week 6](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-7020-Database_and_Business_Intelligence/tree/master/Week6_CuttingEdge_Proposal), a detailed analysis of Quantum technologies is available and how these concepts can be applied to software design patterns.

## CYBERSECURITY -- the No. 1 threat facing manufacturers (2018)

In _Industrial Management. Jul/Aug2018, Vol. 60 Issue 4, p24-27. 4p._; [Erickson, A; Neilson, T](CyberSecurityManufactures.pdf) states that manufactures are a primary target for cybersecurity attacks and need to be aware of the risks.  Many manufactures do not believe that they are at risk and this makes them vulnerable.

> Hackers largely target the manufacturing industry to steal trade secrets, business plans and valuable intellectual property.

### How are they being attacked

- Espionage and Intellectual Property Theft
- Ransomware for Revenue
- Pure destruction and harm

### Impact of attacks

- Harm to reputation
- Destruction of data
- Loss in productivity
- Theft of intellectual property
- Theft of personal employee data
- Disruption to business continuity
- Damage to physical facilities
- Liability or fines for noncompliance with data-privacy regulations
- Possible legal action by customers and employees whose personal information has been breached
- Possible employees suing for lost wages if the company can’t pay due to the breach
- Costs of remediating the damage itself

### What is password spraying

An effective low-tech strategy is to run password cracking across the org instead of an individual account.  By guessing across all accounts that "12345" is the password it avoids detection and an individual account becoming disabled.

### How should we approach cybersecurity risk

The organization needs to define the risks towards its continutity, and then from the C-level down be responsible through ownership.  Challenges from cyber attacks need the same attention as any other aspect, such as supply chain shock or cash flow management.  When these issues are ignored they become a timebomb that will eventually cause a distruption and impact the companies ability to deliver success.
