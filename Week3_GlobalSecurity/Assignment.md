# Evaluate the Global Cybersecurity Position for a Significant Organization

Choose an organization that has exposure to international influences and budgets exceeding $100 million. This organization should have a presence on the web so that your academic readers can understand the industry and the organization.

For the selected organization, analyze the cybersecurity risks faced from abroad, detailing processes used to establish the risk, enable threats, and identify how there might be harmful to some parties. In addition, outline how the organization can reduce these risks, detailing people, products, or processes that could help with risk reduction. Furthermore, provide a rough estimate of the total resources needed and their potential cost. Finally, explain how you might acquire access to the resources to execute your proposed cyber defenses.
