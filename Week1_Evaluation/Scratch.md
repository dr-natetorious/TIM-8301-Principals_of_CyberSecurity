# Section II

When a retailer opens a physical storefront, there are several inherent risks to consider.  For example, thieves steal inventory, employees embezzle funds, and viral pandemics prevent customer transactions.  Store owners mitigate these attack vectors by installing cameras, limiting access to business accounts, and purchasing insurance policies.  As the business expands its presence to include digital assets, like e-commerce and social media platforms, a similar need exists for protections across these artifacts.  However, it can be challenging to provide these security assurances because of the interconnectivity of network technology.  When a thief steals from the storefront, they need to be local, versus the ecommerce site offers global access.

Home users want to privately surf the internet, chat with friends, and make online purchases securely and reliably.  Numerous threats exist

Mickens (2018) states, “the goal of computer security is to ensure that systems do the right thing, even in the presence of malicious inputs.”  Th

	The interconnected nature of modern businesses, across a hybrid of technologies, creates protecting these incredibly complex systems challenging.  Vulnerabilities and configuration errors exist in all levels of the network topology.  For instance, low-level routers and switches require policies that monitor traffic, enforce authorization and encryption, and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) objectives.  Next, critical infrastructure services like Domain Name Services (DNS) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) can cascade failures and cause widespread outages.  Numerous network applications span the local and cloud infrastructure, leveraging proprietary communication protocols that occur inside of encrypted channels, making inspection difficult.  Employees also represent critical targets
