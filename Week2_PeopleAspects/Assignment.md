# Assess and Improve the People Aspects of Cybersecurity

Technology delivers improved opportunities for success to an organization, by facilitating innovation and value creation. These same elements create an increased exposure for cybersecurity risks while also providing an opportunity for defense.

## Part I: Create a presentation

In a `PowerPoint presentation to senior management of an organization` that comprises of more than 1,000 employees and $100 million of turnover, detail the issues and opportunities.

Within the presentation, carefully organize and then (1) deliver details of the important elements and (2) the implied influences that relate to technology and cybersecurity. In `each area`, identify (3) losses that might be incurred and (4) key opportunities to improve the probability of success when (6) working with people involved in (7) creating and using technology systems.

References: Support your presentation with no fewer than `8 scholarly sources` published within the last five years, and source them from the NCU Library. You may add additional quality sources from the NCU Library or the Internet.

Length: Your PowerPoint presentation should consist of a (8) title page, (9) a page of objectives, (10) `15 to 18 slides of content`, a (11) concluding slide, (12) and references. Construct your presentation for a live delivery to executive managers. Include (13) at least 2 tables, images, or Word Art elements that you have created.

## Part II: Give the presentation

Record your voice using any technique that can lead to a standard output and PowerPoint file with bullets and citations in the notes area of your content slides. Upload your PowerPoint file plus any relevant files or links appropriate for playback on simple and common commuter installations (examples might be voiceover PowerPoint, MP4 files, or web links).

Or

Alternatively, provide `150 to 200 words of quality content` and citations in the Speaker Notes area below each of the content slides.

## Additional Requirements

Your PowerPoint should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
