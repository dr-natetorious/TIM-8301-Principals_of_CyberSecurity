Histrocially attackers have gone after the networking topology directly, however this approach has evolved to target the application directly.  This enables them to avoid many protections like firewalls and go after the data directly.  Their objective typically centers around exfiltration, destruction, or holding hostage.  These issues are becoming fairly common place through simple strategies like malicious email attachments.  When the organization lacks controls to protect against these aspects it costs them an average of 5.5 million dollars to recover.  

### Why does traditional security mitigation fail

> Historically, organizations have relied on perimeter defenses to keep their networks and data secure. Unfortunately, network firewalls and network vulnerability scanners cannot defend against application-level attacks. By design, web applications permit unknown users to interact with data and systems. This interaction passes through network
defense mechanisms such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, leaving business vulnerable to malicious attacks.

### How much does an incident cost

> Approximately 72 percent of exposed companies employed 100 or fewer individuals, [and encountered an] average cost of a data breach was $5.5 million in 2011, according to the 2011 Cost of Data Breach report.  Recovery costs following a breach typically stem from investigating the cause of the breach; notifying customers or employees affected; managing inquiries
from those affected; public relations; legal defense; regulatory proceedings; fines and penalties; and credit or identity monitoring.

## Breaking the cyber-security dilemma: aligning security needs and removing vulnerabilities (2014)

Dunn Cavelty M. Breaking the cyber-security dilemma: aligning security needs and removing vulnerabilities. Science and engineering ethics. 2014;20(3):701-715. doi:10.1007/s11948-014-9551-y. Journal: [BreakingCyberDilemma.pdf](BreakingCyberDilemma.pdf)

The author describes how the global expense on security continues to rise, however there are more vulnerabilities and the ecosystem is inheritely less secure.  They point to a growing need of actors (e.g., national states) to put their political agenda ahead of peoples rights (see Kovac week3).  Instead, there needs to be a stronger focus on the human aspect and framing of what security means for the enduser.

> I trace two elements: the specificities of the `threat` and the related `referent object` (that which is seen in need of protection). In any political process, the definition of
referent objects is not only closely connected to how a danger is viewed, it also is an unavoidable decision since any danger discourse must be tied to some kind of endangered entity to become meaningful (Hagmann and Dunn Cavelty 2012).  What is shown in this chapter is that the `human` is presented as a direct threat in the form of the (evil) hacker, the inadequate software developer or system administrator, but is hardly ever a specific and direct referent object of security.

Vulnerabilities exist across all aspects of the networking ecosystem due to a collection of reasons, such as the time pressure to quickly deliver commercial software.  This results in a lot of edges being cut along the way.  There can also be economic incentives to keep things insecure, as big data collection enables the business to taylor marketing campaigns more efficiently.

To get out of the this state there needs to be a fundamental pivot, that focuses on `human security` instead of `technology security`.  It is not possible to seperate the people from the tooling, but instead there needs to policies that considers the needs of both resources.  At odds against this position are national states that seek to force their political agendas under the disguise of national security.

> It has been suspected for a while and is now confirmed that the intelligence services of this world are making cyberspace more insecure directly; in order to be able to have more access to data, and in order to prepare for future conflict. It has been revealed that the NSA has bought and exploited so-called zero-day vulnerabilities in current operating systems and hardware to inject NSA malware into numerous strategically opportune points of the Internet infrastructure (Greenwald and MacAskill 2013).

## STPA-SafeSec: Safety and security analysis for cyber-physical systems (2017)

Friedberg, I., McLaughlin, K., Smith, P., Laverty, D., & Sezer, S. (2017). STPA-SafeSec: Safety and security analysis for cyber-physical systems. Journal of Information Security and Applications Volume 34, Part 2, June 2017, Pages 183-196. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2016.05.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2016.05.008). Journal: [SafeSec.pdf](SafeSec.pdf)

The authors propose that critical vulnerabilities in cyber-physical processes are often untreated because they lack understanding of scope.  They propose a framework that centers around safetey analsyis to gain these insights and associate an appropriate prioritization level.

## Combining cybersecurity and cyber defense to achieve cyber resilience (2017)

Galinec, D., & Steingartner, W. (2017). Combining cybersecurity and cyber defense to achieve cyber resilience. Paper presented at the 14th International Scientific Conference on Informatics.  14-16 Nov. 2017 Poprad, Slovakia. Published by IEEE.  [https://doi.org/10.1109/INFORMATICS.2017.8327227](https://doi.org/10.1109/INFORMATICS.2017.8327227). Conference Paper: [CyberResilience.pdf](CyberResilience.pdf)

The authors suggest that we need to combine `cybersecurity` and `information security` in a manner that results in `cyber resilience`.  As discussed numerous times, there is not a consistent definition of cybersecurity and terminalogies have evolved over time from militaristic and private sector adoptions. _With breaches on the rise, companies should focus on cyber resilience, not just cyber security_ (pg. 89).

> While there are many broader definitions of cybersecurity, there is a difference between the access control of cybersecurity and the more strategic, long-term thinking cyber resilience should evoke. Additionally, since vulnerability in one area can compromise the entire network, resilience requires a conversation focused on systems rather than individual organizations.

### What definitions do the authors provide

- **Cybersecurity** is the governance, development, management and use of information security, OT security, and IT security tools and techniques for achieving regulatory
compliance, defending assets and compromising the assets of adversaries.
- **Cyber Defense** is a computer network defense mechanism which includes response to actions and critical infrastructure protection and information
assurance for organizations, government entities and other possible networks.
- **Cyber resilience** is the ability of a system, organization, mission, or business process to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt capabilities in the face of adversary conditions, stresses, or attacks on the cyber resources it needs to function.

### What challenges require more visibility

> While the cost of defending cyber structures as well as the payoffs from successful attacks keeps rising, the cost of launching an attack simultaneously keeps decreasing [7]. [...] If there isn’t sufficient visibility of cyber security status, organizations won’t be able to manage cyber security risks and they will almost certainly suffer a breach.

Only by pulling together all of the relevant indicators and partial views we can develop overall risk-based measurement and visibility of our cyber security status:

- Be able to identify risks that we aren’t prepared to tolerate and have a clear and prioritized risk-based action plan for the control improvements necessary to reduce these risks to an acceptable level
- To have a better understanding of the implications from threat intelligence or outputs from SIEM and data analytics allowing faster, better targeted responses
- To develop risk-based justifications for investment in cyber security solutions and services.

### What emerging risks need consideration

`Future Studies Note`: Page 90 contains an extensive list of Garden 2020 predictions

- 99% of vulnerabilities could be prevented through patch management
- 33% of successful attacks could be prevented through _e a culture of acceptance and protection versus detection and punishment_
- 20% of businesses will prevent data breaches in the cloud by adopting of security governance policies
- 40% will engage in devops models of self-diagnostics and protections
- 80% of services will broker into the cloud
- 60% of mobile apps will adopt native containment versus third-party solutions
- 40% of authorization will be from IDaaS
- 55% decreased use of password and token use in medium risk use cases
- 50% of IoT manufactures will not address threats of weak authentication
- 25% of enterprise attacks will involve IoT
- 10% of security buget will go toward IoT mitigations

## The impact of information sharing on cybersecurity underinvestment: A real options perspective (2015)

Gordon, L. A., Loeb, M. P., Lucyshyn, W., & Zhou, L. (2015). The impact of information sharing on cybersecurity underinvestment: A real options perspective. Journal of Accounting and Public Policy Volume 34, Issue 5, September–October 2015, Pages 509-519. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2015.05.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2015.05.001). Journal: [SecurityUnderInvestment.pdf](SecurityUnderInvestment.pdf)

> These investments relate to such things as encryption techniques, access controls, firewalls, anti-malware software, intrusion prevention and detection systems, data segregation, and personnel training. Clearly, the amount a firm should invest in cybersecurity activities depends (in part) on the cost-benefit (i.e., economic) aspects of such investments.

The authors state that many organizations approach security from a cost-benefit perspective, however this is flawed because it compares a future theoritical cost against an present actualized expense.  This mentality causes many businesses to defer investments until they are in a reactive state versus a proactive scenario.  Executive Order 13636 (Obama 2013), states that _it is the policy of the US Govt to increase the volume, timeliness, and quality of threat information_, to better assist private sector decision makers with this trade-off.

Investments do not need to be now or never, `deferment option` can also take a phased approach that piecemeals iterative improvements.  _As discussed in the real options literature, the value of a deferment option is positively associated with the degree of uncertainty associated with the investment decision’s payoff_ (pg. 513). An example company might allocate 2.5M dollars for security expenditures and permit the CSO to spend 60% on "high probability" (e.g. anti-virus software).  The remaining 40% requires board approval as these less quantifable risks come into scope.  This directly aligns with the goals of Obama to `share risk information`.  Using a weighted expected value  the business can determine if that remaining 1M is better spent today or next month, and these weights require industry specific risk assessments through information sharing.

> There are several implications of the analysis presented in the previous section of this paper. The first implication is that information sharing has the potential for reducing the uncertainty surrounding cybersecurity investment decisions. As a result of this reduction in uncertainty, the value of the option to defer cybersecurity investments is reduced. Thus, as shown in our example, information sharing is likely to have a calculable positive expected value on decisions to invest in cybersecurity activities now rather than to defer such investments. [...] Everything else equal, reducing the uncertainty surrounding cybersecurity investment decisions should encourage more timely, and more cost efficient, cybersecurity investments.

## Holding the Line: Events that Shaped Healthcare Cybersecurity (2017)

[https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.2345/0899-8205-51.s6.30](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.2345/0899-8205-51.s6.30).  Article: [EventsShapedHealthcare.pdf](EventsShapedHealthcare.pdf).

This short read highlights the various major events that have caused the current perspective on healthcare security.  These include a evolution toward regulatory requirements such as HIPPA and HITECH that require protections of patient data and devices.  The attacks have also transitioned toward ransomware as this is an economical attack that directly results in financial gains.

## Cybersecurity protection for power grid control infrastructures (2017)

## Cybersecurity Concerns and Medical Devices: Lessons From a Pacemaker Advisory (2005)

Kramer, D. B., & Fu, K. (2017). Cybersecurity Concerns and Medical Devices: Lessons From a Pacemaker Advisory. Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), 318(21), 2077–2078. [https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1001/jama.2017.15692](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1001/jama.2017.15692). Article: [PacemakerAdvisory.pdf](PacemakerAdvisory.pdf)

As pacemakers and other permenant medical devices become more sophisticated there is an increased risk due to the additional attack surface.  In this specific case, the device supports wifi communication for publishing telemetry and downloading fireware updates.  A vulnerability was found in an Abbott Labs model, and this creates challenges with controlling the public relations of the entire industry.  While other models might not exhibit the flaw, it raises concerns from doctors and patients that their sensitive information might be leaked or become infected with malware.
