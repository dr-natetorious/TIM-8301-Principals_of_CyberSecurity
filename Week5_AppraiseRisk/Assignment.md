Select a financial institution, high-tech manufacturer, or a hospital that has `no fewer than 500 employees` and provide guidance regarding the risks faced by the organization. Consider the [1] organization that you select and name, [2] as well as the industry in your response. Your guidance is `directed to the Chief Information Officer (CIO)` as a result of the concern during a period where the Chief Security Office (CSO) is not available. **You need to fill in for the CIO**.

Review [3] key external influences on risk and then [4] outline the most important influences from within the organization. Start by selecting [6] any appropriate laws, [7] standards, [8] frameworks, and [9] theories that should underscore your guidance.

Use [10] the foundation to establish a strong framework allowing you to provide `a convincing and logical response`, leading to the acceptance of your guidance. Your response should `be persuasive and supported by both scholarly sources` and especially any relevant legislation, standards, frameworks, and theories. Despite the formal foundation, including a `strong focus on practical issues and values` that can be used to motivate resources for the proposed mitigation in Week 6. Note that the `focus this week is on risk and guidance`, **not** mitigationâ€”that follows in Week 6.
