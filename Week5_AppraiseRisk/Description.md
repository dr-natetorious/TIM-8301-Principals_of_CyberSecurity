# Week 5: Risk Frameworks and Models

If there is no risk, there is no need for a reaction. Organizations have limited budgets with exceptionally large needs across all fronts. The need to establish and measure credible risks will be exceptionally important to acquire the required budget or resources to reduce or overcome risks. A logical and scientific analysis of risk that can provide confidence to your organization will be paramount. Too often, cybersecurity personnel has good ideas, but they are not able to communicate them in such a way that resources are allocated to attend to a risk.

You have explicit objectives within the introductory materials anchored in the common body of knowledge (ISC)2 publication covered in various locations on their website. Other valuable sources on the Internet include SANS, which includes extensive sections regarding governance and risk. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides the cybersecurity framework, and the risk management framework. These website links can be found in your Course Resources module in the Table of Contents.

The general approaches to risk treatment are risk acceptance, risk avoidance, risk reduction, and risk transfer. The use of any of these treatments depends on the attacks, the risks that the organization is subjected due to the attacks, and the mitigation strategies that have been implemented. Additionally, the use of a security framework such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, CoBIT, and ITIL can make a difference in reducing and mitigating attack surfaces and cyber risks.

Review the resources listed in the introduction and the Resources area to prepare for this week's assignment.
